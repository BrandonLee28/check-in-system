# Brandon's Check In System
----
## Description
I developed a Check-In System initially as a personal project to enhance my resume. Surprisingly, it gained attention from my school and became a project of interest there too. The system incorporates JavaScript for barcode scanning, a Python backend for processing, and HTML with Tailwind CSS for rendering the user interface.
